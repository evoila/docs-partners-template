This topic describes how to use the Service Dashboard

## <a id="access-dashboard"></a> Access Dashboard
To access the Dashboard two different options do exist:

* CLI
* Apps Manager

### CLI
Accessing the Dasboard via CLI is relatively easy. Before you can access the URL to open the Service Dashboard, you need to login via CF CLI. After you have selected the Organisation 
and Space issue `cf services`

This should produce an output as following:

```bash
cf services
Getting services in org demo / space demo-test as admin...

name                                service               plan   bound apps   last operation
YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE_MYSQL         osb-mysql-test        s                   create succeeded
YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE_POSTGRESQL    osb-postgresql-test   s                   create succeeded
````

After you have selected the Service you want to access via Dashboard, you need to issue `cf service SERVICE_NAME`.

This should produce an output as following:

```bash
service postgres-test
Showing info of service postgres-test in org demo / space demo-test as admin...

name:            postgres-test
service:         osb-postgresql-test
bound apps:
tags:
plan:            s
description:     PostgreSQL Instances
documentation:

Showing status of last operation from service postgres-test...

```

To finally access the Dashboard, please follow the link under `dashboard`. In this case: `https://osb-postgresql-test.cf.domain.com/custom/v2/authentication/312648fd-d987-470a-b7c0-2d7dadf8b0ee`

After you entered the link in your browser, press `Enter` and follow the documentation at **Dashboard Login**.

### Apps Manager
To access the Service Broker Dashboards of the PCF App Manager click on the Services section in your organization and space. Select the
service you want to configure, which should lead you to the service details page.

After opening the service details page, you should see a `Manage` link in the upper right corner, which you can click to get to the **Dashboard Login**.

**HINT:** It should be the same Credentials that are used on the CF CLI or in Apps Manager.

## <a id="dashboard-sections"></a> Dashboard Sections
The Dashboard consists of multiple sections, which will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

* Welcome Page
* Configuration
* Backup Management
* Service Keys

### <a id="support-and-docs"></a> Welcome Page
The Dashboard Overview is the landing page, when using the Service Broker options. Based on the options a Service Broker offers
you can find there a general description, the links to the documentation, backup management and service keys.

### <a id="support-and-docs"></a> Configuration
If the feature is enabled for the Service Broker the configuration section allows you to configure your service on a pre-selected amount of 
configuration elements. If you don't find a configuration option you would expect, please contact us.

When you change the configuration in the upper right corner you can see a spinning circle. By clicking on it, you can also see the current
action being executed.

### <a id="support-and-docs"></a> Backup Management
If the feature is enabled for the Service Broker, the backup management section allows you to configure and schedule the backup management
for your endpoint service.

specific app.

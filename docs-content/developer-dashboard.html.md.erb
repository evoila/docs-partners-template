This topic describes how to use the Service Dashboard

## <a id="access-dashboard"></a> Access Dashboard
To access the Dashboard two different options do exist:

* Apps Manager
* CLI


### CLI
Accessing the Dasboard via CLI is relatively easy. Before you can access the URL to open the Service Dashboard, you need to login via CF CLI. After you have selected the Organisation 
and Space issue `cf services`

This should produce an output as following:

```bash
cf services
Getting services in org demo / space demo-test as admin...

name               service               plan   bound apps   last operation
osb-mysql-test-s   osb-mysql-test        s                   create succeeded
postgres-test      osb-postgresql-test   s                   create succeeded
````

After you have selected the Service you want to access via Dashboard, you need to issue `cf service SERVICE_NAME`.

This should produce an output as following:

```bash
service postgres-test
Showing info of service postgres-test in org demo / space demo-test as admin...

name:            postgres-test
service:         osb-postgresql-test
bound apps:

After you entered the link in your browser, press `Enter` and follow the documentation at **Dashboard Login**.

# Using a Service in an App
For the services which provide credentials to a service backend, you need to rely on the contents of VCAP_SERVICES. A VCAP_SERVICES section might look as follows:

```
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "osb-postgresql": [
   {
    "binding_name": null,
    "credentials": {
     "database": "f3092088",
     "password": "JzW58hcKCO7S9ul",
     "uri": "postgres://2iYQ9piY4b:JzW58hcKCO7S9ul@10.0.64.29:5432/f3092088",
     "user": "2iYQ9piY4b"
    },
    "instance_name": "prod-psql",
    "label": "osb-postgresql",
    "name": "prod-psql",
    "plan": "s",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ],
  "osb-rabbitmq": [
   {
    "binding_name": null,
    "credentials": {
     "hostname": "10.0.64.24",
     "name": "192e97e9",
     "password": "D2yw9Nbru9IV6ws",
     "port": 5672,
     "uri": "amqp://Z2nSRnfxNj:D2yw9Nbru9IV6ws@10.0.64.24:5672/192e97e9",
     "user": "Z2nSRnfxNj",
     "vhost": "192e97e9"
    },
    "instance_name": "prod-rabbitmq",
    "label": "osb-rabbitmq",
    "name": "prod-rabbitmq",
    "plan": "xs",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ],
  ...
 }
}
```

As you can see from above the basic structure is the same for all service instances, while the contents for a specific service may differ. The most important part of each entry in VCAP_SERVICES is the credential section, which 
contains all relevant information like `name`, `username`, `password`, `host` etc. 

## Recommendation
When you try to retrieve you service in the VCAP_SERVICES section implement the retrieval based on the key of the corresponding service, e.g. `osb-rabbitmq` and the filter by `instance_name` and or `tags`.
